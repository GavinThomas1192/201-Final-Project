It's Friday, sunny, and you can't help but go outside and do something! So you decide to go running down 2nd Avenue dodging cars, bikes, and drunk pedestrians. After getting home you quickly come to realize that the run you just had was amazing! So amazing you decide to start a "Workout Journal". You bust out your old dusty journal with rips and tears all throughout and try to find a pen from your junk drawer. Fifteen long minutes later you think to yourself "there has to be a better way". Well we are here to tell you that there is a better way, verve!

verve.com is your all in one stop for activity journaling. Upon navigating to verve'S beautiful homepage you won't help but notice it's simple, neat, yet elegant design. The modern layout with a giant hero image will captivate you into continually wanting more and more. After scanning over the large hero image your eyes will be drawn to the center of the page where you will login and see a simple drop down menu. This menu will contain a list of numerous activities that you can click on. Once clicking the desired activity you wish to journal about the page will reload into yet another large hero image. This time the image won't be the same as the homepage but one that is directly related to activity that you selected from the drop down. This will create the perfect atmosphere to bring your mind, body, and senses back to your prior workout. Once you're ready to journal you can click on a neat form that will take in the date of workout, location, duration, and description. Once you have finished journaling you can save your entry into the website which you can access by clicking the view journal button. This will take you to the journal page where your old journal entries are displayed back to you in chronological order.

After journaling to your hearts content about the activity you can simply leave the webpage and it will save automatically. The next time you feel like journaling you can simply navigate to verve.com on your computer or phone to view your old entries or create new ones.
